JsoGen

by Bosco So <rubymeetup _AT_ boscoso _DOT_ com>

JsoGen is a command line script that generates GWT JavaScript Overlay
Object classes based on JSON retrieved from an URL. It was written to
make it easier and less error prone to generate GWT JSO source files
when given a representative JSON string.

Invoke JsoGen on the command line with the following:

jso_gen.rb URL

This will generate as many JSO source files as necessary to represent
the JSON emitted by URL. These source files will have mangled class
names to remain distinct from each other. Any tool with refactoring
capability (i.e., Eclipse) will let you rename them as appropriate. Or
you can simply use a text editor.

If you pass an optional package name on the command line, the output
source files will use that as its package specifier.
